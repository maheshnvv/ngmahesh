# Workspace Rename Summary

## Changes Made

The workspace has been successfully renamed from `ng-osm-workspace` to `ngmahesh` to align with the npm scope and branding.

### Files Updated:

1. **package.json**
   - Changed `"name": "ng-osm-workspace"` to `"name": "ngmahesh"`

2. **angular.json**
   - Changed project name from `ng-osm-workspace` to `ngmahesh`
   - Updated output path from `dist/ng-osm-workspace` to `dist/ngmahesh`
   - Updated build targets references

3. **GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml)**
   - Updated distribution path references from `ng-osm-workspace` to `ngmahesh`

4. **Test Files**
   - Updated `src/app/app.component.spec.ts` to test for correct homepage content
   - Updated `apps/ng-osm-map-demo/app.component.spec.ts` with new workspace name
   - Updated backup demo component files

5. **Documentation**
   - Updated `documentation.html` with new project structure reference

### Build Output Changes:
- Main application now builds to: `dist/ngmahesh/`
- Library still builds to: `dist/ng-osm-map/` (unchanged)

### Regenerated Files:
- `package-lock.json` - Regenerated with new workspace name
- `dist/` folder - Rebuilt with new structure

## Verification Steps Completed:

1. ✅ Deleted old dist folder
2. ✅ Regenerated package-lock.json 
3. ✅ Successfully built library: `npm run build:lib`
4. ✅ Successfully built main app: `npm run build`
5. ✅ Verified new directory structure:
   - `dist/ngmahesh/` (main app)
   - `dist/ng-osm-map/` (library)

## Next Steps:

1. **Directory Rename**: You mentioned you can rename the directory manually. The suggested new name would be:
   - From: `ng-osm-workspace`
   - To: `ngmahesh`

2. **Update Repository URLs**: If you plan to update the GitHub repository name, remember to also update:
   - Library package.json repository URLs
   - README links
   - CI/CD workflow references

## npm Scripts Available:

```bash
npm run build:lib      # Build the library
npm run test:lib       # Test the library  
npm run build          # Build the homepage
npm start              # Serve development version
npm run publish:lib    # Publish library to npm
```

All references to the old workspace name have been successfully updated and the project builds correctly with the new `ngmahesh` name.
